# Project Report

### 11/23/25:

- Created and pushed the following files

```
assets/
    with some icon files for previous projects
scripts/
    main.js
styles/
    styles.css
index.html
README.md
ProjectReport.md
```

Mostly just trying to get the repo and project setup. Assets will be a folder for image files needed for the website. Scripts will be a folder for any eventual JavaScript files. Styles will be a folder for any cascading style sheets used in this website. Index.html is the main page for the website. ProjectReport.md will be for required class updates such as this one.

- Created prototype nav bar

Copied nav bar from class homework exercise. I also modified it a bit, including adding my own colors. I will need to go back later and work on it some more, but it's a good enough starting point.

### 11/24/25

- Created section elements for all 4 required sections. Set up some early css formating for them as well.

- Updated nav bar to support smaller screens. On mobile and tablet screens nav buttons are replaced with selection box to save space, using media queries.

- Started add some info the created section elements.

### 11/27/25

- Added more info to required sections. Such as employment and education info.

- Further refined css formatting for required information sections. Such as adding borders and changing some rows to columns for better use of space and formatting.

### 11/28/2025

- Further refined css formatting for required information sections. Such as recoloring borders and background color for better contrast and aesthetics.

- Added a basic footer, will need to further refine later as it has some padding issues. Includes a JS function to update copyright year automatically.

- Started grid element for projects section. Uses a grid-container class with grid-item class as child elements. Allows for a n x 3 table of project items, each project item gets a title, image, description, optional fieldset for featured info, and code source button.

- Refined grid element to have better formatting. Main goal was to get everything to be spaced nicely and for colors to have better contrast.

## 12/4/2025

- Created @media queries for smaller screen devices. Primarly just wanted to make sure things like containers and text scaled in a nice way when the screen size changes. For tablet screen ratios, I have the grid go down to two columns to save space, and 1 column for mobile ratios. I also made the section containers for the site slightly larger for smaller screens than desktop to make better use of limited screen real estate.

- Started contact form section using Web3Forms. Required basic starter code was copied from https://web3forms.com/ but was modified to fit formatting and style of site.

- Revised nav bar to use better formatting. Also fixed the mobile nav menu to work better.

## 12/6/2025

- Further formatted contact form to match site design and provide better user cues. Also added it to @media queries to switch it from being in columns to being in rows when a smaller device is visiting the site.

- Added a section for other contact info, with button links. Such as github and linkedin pages.
