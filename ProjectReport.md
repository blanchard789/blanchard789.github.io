# Project Report

### 11/23/25:

- Created and pushed the following files

```
assets/
    with some icon files for previous projects
scripts/
    main.js
styles/
    styles.css
index.html
README.md
ProjectReport.md
```

Mostly just trying to get the repo and project setup. Assets will be a folder for image files needed for the website. Scripts will be a folder for any eventual JavaScript files. Styles will be a folder for any cascading style sheets used in this website. Index.html is the main page for the website. ProjectReport.md will be for required class updates such as this one.
